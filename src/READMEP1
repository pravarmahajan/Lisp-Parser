(1) To run the parser, type:
make

Once you see '?' the parser is ready to accept input

(2) To clean all the class files, type:
make clean

The program works fine as long as you provide input line by line.
On using redirection/piping, it fails. Haven't been able to figure
out why

I am assuming $ and $$ are going to be in new line and the line does
not contain anything other leading or trailing chars.
Otherwise it's a parsing error
