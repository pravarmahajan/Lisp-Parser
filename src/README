(1) To run the interpreter, type:
make

This will compile all the java files, create class files
and run the Main class.


Once you see '?' the parser is ready to accept input

(2) To clean all the class files, type:
make clean

The program works fine as long as you provide type in input line by line.
On using redirections or piping to provide input from file, it fails.
Haven't been able to figure out why

I am assuming $ and $$ are going to be in new line and the line does
not contain anything other leading or trailing chars.
Otherwise it's a parsing error

Empty $ or $$ results in error too.
